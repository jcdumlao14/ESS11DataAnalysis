        "- **Trust Measures (ppltrst, pplfair, pplhlp)**: People generally score around 5-6 on trusting others and finding them fair and helpful. However, the high skewness and kurtosis values suggest a lot of extreme responses, meaning some people strongly disagree while others strongly agree. The large difference between the median and mean also shows how much the few higher values affect the mean making it skewed towards higher values.\n",
        "- **Trust in Institutions (trstprl, trstplc, trstplt, trstprt, trstun, trstep)**: Trust in political institutions is generally lower than interpersonal trust, with scores often clustered around the median of 4-7, depending on the specific institution. The very high variance and standard deviation indicate a wide range of opinions. The skewness again shows there are some very high values that drastically affect the mean, making it skew away from median and lower values.\n",
        "- **Political Interest (polintr)**: Political interest is moderately low, with an average score around 2.6. The low variance suggests people's interest levels are fairly consistent. The very low Kurtosis also shows that there are very few outliers within the dataset, with the spread being relatively smaller than the rest.\n",
        "- **Feeling of influence on politics (psppsgva, psppipla, cptppola, actrolga)**: The score is generally around 2, showing how most people feel as though their actions are not effective to change anything in politics. with the high Kurtosis also shows how there is a high peak near the mean of the distribution, with majority of the responses gathered near the mean.\n",
        "- **Voting (vote)**: The average vote count is around 1.3 showing that there were some voters and there were non voters within the dataset. And kurtosis is high due to the limited values of 0 and 1, which skews the results.\n",
        "- **Satisfaction (stflife, stfeco, stfgov, stfdem, stfedu, stfhlth)**: The mean values for overall satisfaction are clustered around 5.5-8 depending on what they are satisfied with, with many extreme results, making it skewed to the higher results. Overall the spread is very wide, with high kurtosis values suggesting that the distribution is very peaked, with a high variance suggesting that there are a lot of responses scattered over the dataset.\n",
        "- **Immigration Attitudes (imsmetn, imdfetn, impcntr, imbgeco, imueclt, imwbcnt)**: Similar to satisfaction, immigration attitudes score a mean of 2-8 depending on the category.

        "Climate change attitude averages around 6-8, showing how the average person feels, however the amount of skew shows that the responses drastically vary over different people with some being extremely different from each other.\n",
        "- **Work and Class Attitudes (wrclmch)**: the mean response of 3.2 shows how overall the amount of working class is the most dominant with limited responses. With a low kurtosis, this suggests that there isn't a significant outlier, and the low variance also shows that the spread in the dataset is relatively small, meaning the general attitudes of the respondents are similar.\n",
